>
> **Boyfriend:** "I have no idea. Woudn't be nice if there was an app that chooses this kind of thing for you?"
>
> **Girfriend:** "I'm pretty sure that this already exists"
>
> **Boyfriend:** "Yeah... But I want to learn Typescript :D"

## The solution (**[youchoose.fabioromeiro.com.br](http://youchoose.fabioromeiro.com.br)**)
An app where you can regist fast-foods (or anything kind of capitalism) and raffle your list based on price (or not) choosing the one that you're gonna let your sacred money. ~~If the app choose one and you opt to raffle again, it means that YOU ALREADY HAV AN F****ING ANSWER, ACCEPT IT AND GO EAT~~
